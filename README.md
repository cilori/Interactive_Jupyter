# Introducing Interactivity into Jupyter Notebooks
##### Workshop facilitator: Laura Gutierrez Funderburk | Department of Mathematics | Simon Fraser University

##### Workshop date: October 9 2018

## Abstract

In this workshop we will explore the use of Jupyter Widgets and how they allow developers to add an interactive element to Jupyter notebooks. 

## Getting Started

### Important: 

If you have an SFU login account, you can skip installing Python and simply access one of [SFU's Jupyter servers](https://sfu.syzygy.ca/)

### Otherwise...

Ensure you have installed Python on your local computer. Throughout these exercises, I will be using Python 3.6. One of the easiest ways to install Python on your local computer is by downloading and installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux). I strongly recommend installing Anaconda as it includes Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib and other packages that will be used throughout this workshop. 

### Documentation

[Installing Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/#detailed-installation-information)

[Installing Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install)

## Introduction

<a href="http://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebooks</a> are a powerful tool to program in Python/R and share information. The key feature we will explore in this notebook is the flexibility that Jupyter allows to explore code for both programmers and non-programmers. In this series of notebooks we will explore that versatility and allow programmers to learn about how they can use Python and Jupyter widgets and magics to make their notebooks more user friendly and add an element of interactivity.

## Acknowledgements

I thank Dr. Cedric Chauve for his encouragement and involvement in my development. This workshop was inspired on the basis of my learning experiences with him as a <a href="https://callysto.ca/" target="_blank">Callysto</a> Developer during Summer 2018. I also ackowledge and thank Callysto Developers Howell Tan and Jenifer Pham, whom I learned with many of the concepts shared throughout this workshop.
