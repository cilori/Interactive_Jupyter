# Introducing Interactivity into Jupyter Notebooks
##### Workshop facilitator: Laura Gutierrez Funderburk | Department of Mathematics | Simon Fraser University

##### Workshop date: October 9 2018

## Abstract

In this workshop we will explore the use of Jupyter Widgets and how they allow developers to add an interactive element to Jupyter notebooks. 

## Getting Started

### Important: 

If you have an SFU login account, you can skip installing Python and simply access one of [SFU's Jupyter servers](https://sfu.syzygy.ca/)

### Otherwise...

Ensure you have installed Python on your local computer. Throughout these exercises, I will be using Python 3.6. One of the easiest ways to install Python on your local computer is by downloading and installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux). I strongly recommend installing Anaconda as it includes Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib and other packages that will be used throughout this workshop. 

### Documentation

[Installing Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/#detailed-installation-information)

## Acknowledgements

I thank Dr. Cedric Chauve for his encouragement and involvement in my development. This workshop was inspired on the basis of my learning experiences with him as a <a href="https://callysto.ca/">Callysto</a> Developer during Summer 2018. I also ackowledge and thank Callysto Developers Howell Tan and Jenifer Pham, whom I learned with many of the concepts shared throughout this workshop.
